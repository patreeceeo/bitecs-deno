# bitecs-deno
Port of @NateTheGreatt's ECS with minimal modifications to work in Deno.

# Usage

Import from https://deno.land/x/bitecs/index.mjs, or add that URL to an `importmap`, and start using `bitecs` just like you would if using Node/NPM.

See https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/bitECS for documentation about `bitecs` itself.
