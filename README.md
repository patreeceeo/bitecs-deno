# bitecs-deno
Port of @NateTheGreatt's ECS with minimal modifications to work in [Deno](https://deno.land).

# Usage

Import from https://deno.land/x/bitecs/index.mjs, or add that URL to an `importmap`, and start using `bitecs` just like you would if using Node/NPM.

Then check out [the original `bitecs` repo](https://github.com/NateTheGreatt/bitECS) for more info.

# Versions

The above will default to the latest version. To use a specific version, add @<version> after "bitecs." 

Since there hasn't been an official release of `bitecs` in a while, I've resorted to using the date of commits to `bitecs` as the version string.
